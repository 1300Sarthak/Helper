# Claude to Gemini Migration

## Overview

Successfully migrated all API functionality from Claude to Gemini API. The system now uses Google's Gemini as the primary AI assistant for all operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Services Updated

- **`services/gemini_service.py`**: Enhanced to include complete AI assistant functionality
  - Added `get_support_response()` function (previously Claude-only)
  - Added system prompts for "empathetic_coach" and "direct_assistant" modes
  - Integrated RAG pipeline support
  - Enhanced with user context handling
  - Maintained existing journal analysis and emotion scoring capabilities

### 2. Routes Updated

- **`routes/chat.py`**: Changed imports from `claude_service` to `gemini_service`
- Updated all function calls and comments to reference Gemini instead of Claude

### 3. Configuration Updated

- **`config.py`**: Added `GEMINI_API_KEY` configuration
- Maintained legacy CAG configuration for compatibility

### 4. Documentation Updated

- **`architecture.md`**: Updated AI orchestration section to reflect Gemini as primary AI
- Updated service descriptions and flow diagrams
- Removed Claude-specific references

### 5. RAG Pipeline Enhanced

- **`services/rag_pipeline.py`**: Added `format_resources_for_gemini()` method

### 6. Testing

- **`test_gemini.py`**: Created new comprehensive test file for Gemini integration
- **`test_chat_endpoint.py`**: Updated references to Gemini
- **`test_claude.py`**: Kept for legacy compatibility

## New Functionality

### Dual Prompt Types

The Gemini service now supports two interaction modes:

1. **empathetic_coach** (default): Warm, supportive, counselor-like responses
2. **direct_assistant**: Clear, step-by-step, no-nonsense guidance

### Enhanced Context Integration

- User location, situation, and needs are now fully integrated into prompts
- RAG pipeline results are formatted and provided as context to Gemini
- Greeting detection for natural conversation flow

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Required for Gemini functionality
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional legacy
CAG_API_KEY=your_cag_api_key_here
```

## API Endpoints

All existing endpoints remain the same but now use Gemini:

- `POST /api/chat/message` - Main chat interface
- `POST /api/chat/analyze-journal` - Journal analysis
- `GET /api/chat/summarize/<user_id>` - Conversation summarization
- `POST /api/chat/resources` - Resource retrieval

## Testing

Run the new Gemini tests:

```bash
python test_gemini.py
```

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Cost Efficiency**: Gemini typically offers better pricing than Claude
2. **Unified Service**: All AI functionality now handled by single service
3. **Enhanced Capabilities**: Gemini's multimodal capabilities ready for future features
4. **Better Integration**: Designed specifically for Google's ecosystem

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing API endpoints work identically
- Function signatures unchanged
- Database schema unchanged
- Frontend requires no changes
